# Simpleweb

A collection of useful classes for use with Rails.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'simpleweb', git: 'git@github.com:simpleweb/simpleweb-toolkit.git'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

### Model validations

To use model validations include `Simpleweb::Validations` in your model.

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Simpleweb::Validations

  attr_accessible :email, :username

  validates :email, presence: true, email: true
  validates :username, presence: true, username: true
end
```

### Routing constraints

Routing constraints are automatically included in the Rails router.

####Â Subdomain

The `subdomain` constraint allow you to specify routes that should only
be applied for certain subdomains. The `:only` option will only match
the subdomains given, the `:except` option won't match the given
subdomains. There is also a `:tld_length` (should be `1` for `.com`, `2`
for `.co.uk` etc) which defaults to 1.

```ruby
My::Application.routes.draw do
  subdomain only: 'blog' do
    resources :posts
  end

  subdomain except: ['www', 'mail'] do
    resources :spaces
    root to: 'spaces#index'
  end

  root to: 'pages#home'
end
```
